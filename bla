Hi, Karen! This is Kalani. Welcome!

We play rounds of calendar months. March is our second month. Scores for this month look much the same as scores for last month, with Lauren, Jules, and I dominating the competition daily, so watch out for us.

We only have two rules: 

1) Be honest about your score. 
2) Share your results to the group chat before midnight CST. If you miss posting, you're given the max score for the day.

Kyle keeps score, so does Debbie. Kyle posts score tables daily. If you see an error, just point it out, and he'll revise. 

Payment is collected by the winner in whatever way/s convenient for him/her.
